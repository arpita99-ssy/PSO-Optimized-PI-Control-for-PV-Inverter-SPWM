# PSO-Optimized-PI-Control-for-PV-Inverter-SPWM
This repository presents the design and simulation of a photovoltaic (PV) inverter system controlled using a Proportional–Integral (PI) controller, whose parameters are optimally tuned using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The inverter employs Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) to generate high-quality AC output.
